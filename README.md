# Computational Inclusion Survey


Many areas in academia have recently become increasingly data driven, producing an inexorable amount of data, which in turn has shifted the way we conduct research.

Big data produced in all stages of a research life cycle necessitate different tools, platforms, workflows, applications, resources and computing skills spurring scientific advancement and innovation, along with a shift in societal and research norms towards openness.

Adopting core democratic open science values; such as access to knowledge and data sharing have centre-staged the big data debate. However, when we discuss open science practices, it is important to consider who is in the configuration/capacity of working openly and who is not. 

The debate is geared towards addressing the needs and concerns of the "digitally rich‚Äù i.e those who generate big data and/or have the computational resources for data handling.  

To alleviate the digital divide, it is paramount to ensure equity and inclusion of diverse and under-represented communities in the open science debate by improving computational inclusion. To that end, we need to understand the challenges affecting provision of knowledge and participation in open science. 

In this survey, we aim to assess the academic landscape with regards to;
Which tools are used by researchers at different data life-cycle i.e. Planning, Creation/collection of data, Analysis, Sharing, Preservation.
Which tools are used by researchers in aid of improving computational inclusion such as those used in capacity building/training and community building.
What technological challenges/ shortcomings contribute to reduced computational inclusion.

Furthermore, we will be looking at trends in computational infrastructure and resources in different geographical regions to identify areas with reduced computational inclusion such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  

By gaining insight of the academic computational landscape in different environments, we will have a better understanding of the needs and requirements of individuals from different backgrounds. 

This will aid in bringing together diverse communities with varied computational resources into adopting open science practices while empowering them through community building, inclusive training practices and adapted computational solutions.
